            <h4>Social Prisoner's Dilemma</h4>
            <p>In the social version of the above, we use a simpler scoring table to place a strong bias towards the cooperation-versus-defection aspects only and not the play of the opponent. For this we have two components, M and M'. Where M is the Moral (or social) payoff and rewards cooperation and M' is its counterpart that punishes defection.</p>
