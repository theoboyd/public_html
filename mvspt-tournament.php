            <h3>The Tournament</h3>
               <p>The tournament will follow the <a class="plainlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Round-robin#Computing">round-robin</a> style of the 1980 experiments by <a class="plainlink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Axelrod">Robert Axelrod</a> (each strategy will compete with all other pairings and themselves once). Importantly, he determined a number of qualities that should be followed. So, to improve your success rate, we suggest your gameplay is:</p>
               <ul>
                  <li><strong>Nice</strong> &mdash; Strategies must not be the first to punish. It was noticed that an overwhelming majority of the winning strategies were optimistic in this way.
                  <li><strong>Retaliating</strong> &mdash; Strategies must not be simply blindly optimistic, however, and must respond to punishment appropriately.
                  <li><strong>Forgiving</strong> &mdash; Strategies must forgive previous punishment and resume being nice after having retaliated. This prevents revenge scenarios.
                  <li><strong>Non-envious</strong> &mdash; Strategies should not aim to score more than their opponent. This non-competitive nature seems counter-intuitive but is one of the qualities of the high-scoring nice strategies.
                  <li><strong>Not too clever</strong> &mdash; Strategies that try to make inferences or overly-complex decisions about opponents and gameplay often lose out and should try not to be too clever or tricky.
               </ul>
               <p>Strategies that are submitted will compete over a large number of rounds. Apart from this, they must follow a number of stated restrictions as set out in the Strategy Terms later on this page. A number of simplifications and moral restrictions, such as using $\lambda$ with discrete values and limiting its maximum change, and the specific values for the scores in the tables above, for example, are defined there. Time permitting, we may conduct more than one main tournament, with different rules for each. Otherwise, the only variations should be in the strategies themselves: their strategy (and its complexity), initial social coefficient and starting move.</p>
               <p>The structure will follow this timeline (allowing for more tournamentsif there is time):</p>
               <ol>
                  <li><strong>Friendly Tournament(s)</strong></li>
                  <li>Break &mdash; feedback and time for improvements and resubmission</li>
                  <li><strong>Prize-eligible Tournament</strong></li>
               </ol>
