            <h3>The Game</h3>
            <p>The game to be played is a variant of the Prisoner's Dilemma that incorporates social and material components. You will have the chance to write an algorithm that can play this game against other algorithms (strategies) submitted by players.</p>
            <h4>Original Prisoner's Dilemma</h4>
            <blockquote>Two people are arrested for committing the same crime, but the police do not possess enough information for a conviction. They are separated such that they cannot communicate with each other. The police offer both of them the same deal &mdash; if one testifies against their partner (defects), and the other remains silent (cooperates), the betrayer goes free and the cooperator receives the full one-year sentence. If both remain silent, both are sentenced to only one month in jail for a minor charge. If each betrays the other, each receives a three-month sentence as they will be guaranteed early release by the prosecution. Each prisoner must choose either to betray or remain silent; the decision of each is kept quiet.</blockquote>
            <h4>Dual Game Social Prisoner's Dilemma</h4>
            <p>We want to <strong>play the above game over multiple rounds</strong>, so that players can see what their opponent played previously. Additionally, we will combine two components &mdash; one of materialistic and one of social play &mdash; into a "dual game". Each play strategy should aim to gain both a high material score and also a high social (charitable) score, and how they score will depend on the player's social inclination. This inclination to one side or the other is determined by a social coefficient in the range [0, 1] which is referred to as <code>lambda</code> or $\lambda$.</p>
