            <h3>Rules And Submission</h3>
               <p>Here is where you can submit your strategy! Before that, there are two sets of terms and conditions that you will need to read and agree to. The first is for the rules of the tournament and format of the submitted strategies, which is based on the description above. The second set of rules concerns the technicalities of the competition, the prizes and a few other restrictions, and are equally important.</p>
               <p><span class="fakelink link" id="terms-toggle" onclick="$('#terms-box').toggle(400);">Read the terms</span></p>
               <div id="terms-box" style="display: none;">
                  <br />
                  <?php include('mvspt-tsandcs.php'); ?>
               </div>
               <p><span class="fakelink link" id="upload-toggle" onclick="$('#upload-box').toggle(400);">Agree to the terms and submit</span></p>
               <div id="upload-box" style="display: none;">
                  <br />
                  <?php include('mvspt-uploadstrategy.php'); ?>
               </div>
